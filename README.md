In this repository we will illustrate our thesis work entitled "Deep Learning Classification and Object Detection for Breast Cancer Malignancy Investigation"


## Abstract

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. To increase the chances of survival it is of paramount importance to detect the tumor presence in a timely manner, and this can be achieved by
means of mammography screening. The objective of the work is to identify narrow portions of the image that could potentially contain a tumor lesion (Object Detection) and to perform Image Classification only on those portions. To do this, an Object Detection algorithm was initially trained, and the areas identified by this system (called Regions of Interest or briefly RoIs), after being manually evaluated, were used to train an Image Classification algorithm whose task is to refine the Object Detection evaluation to improve the overall classification performances.
